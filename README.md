## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- FFmpeg *(optional — required only for YouTube audio playback)*
- libopus *(optional — required only for YouTube audio playback)*

### Recommended: Dev Container

This project includes a devcontainer for a consistent development environment. If you're using VS Code with Docker installed:

1. Clone the repo and open it in VS Code
2. When prompted, click **Reopen in Container** (or open the Command Palette and run `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`)
3. The container will build automatically and install all Python dependencies via `postCreateCommand`
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` inside the `python/` directory and fill in your values

> FFmpeg and libopus are **not** installed by the devcontainer. If you need the YouTube cog, install them manually — see the system dependencies step below.

### Manual Setup

#### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mckinneyjaiden5418/Dizznem-Discord-Bot.git
cd Dizznem-Discord-Bot
```

#### 2. Install system dependencies *(YouTube cog only)*

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ffmpeg libopus0 libopus-dev -y
```

If FFmpeg is unavailable via apt, use the static build:

```bash
wget https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/releases/ffmpeg-release-armhf-static.tar.xz
tar xf ffmpeg-release-armhf-static.tar.xz
sudo mv ffmpeg-*-armhf-static/ffmpeg /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg
rm -rf ffmpeg-*
```

> Use `arm64` instead of `armhf` for 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS, or `amd64` for x86.

#### 3. Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r python/requirements.txt --break-system-packages
```

#### 4. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `python/` directory:

```bash
cd python
nano .env
```

Fill in the following:

```dotenv
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=        # Your Discord bot token
DISCORD_BOT_TAG=          # The trigger word for AI chat (e.g. dizznem)
TEST_CHANNEL_ID=          # Channel ID the bot sends a hello message to on startup
INSPIRATION_CHANNEL_ID=   # Channel ID for daily inspiration messages
QOTD_CHANNEL_ID=          # Channel ID for question of the day
ADMIN_ID=                 # Your Discord user ID for admin commands
AI_API_KEY=               # DeepSeek API key for AI chat feature
```

#### 5. Run the bot

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Environment Notes

- `DISCORD_BOT_TAG` is the word that triggers the AI chat (e.g. if set to `dizznem`, saying `dizznem what's up` in chat will get a response)
- The Reddit cog requires a Reddit API key — see [reddit.com/prefs/apps](https://reddit.com/prefs/apps) to set one up
- Stock prices update automatically when the US market opens each day via Yahoo Finance
- The AI feature uses the [DeepSeek API](https://platform.deepseek.com)
